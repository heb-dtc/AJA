###Â Linux groups

In order to have several user share rights on a directory, one can use groups  
- create new group  
`$ sudo groupadd mygroup`  
- add users to the new group  
```
$ sudo usermod -a -G mygroup userOne
$ sudo usermod -a -G mygroup userTwo
```  
- update permission on the directory to be shared amongs users  
```
$ sudo chgrp -R mygroup /path/to/the/directory
$ sudo chmod -R g+w /path/to/the/directory
```  
- update files permissions of the directory so that newly created files are owned by the group  
`$ sudo find /path/to/the/directory -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;`  
- find all files in the directory and add read and write permission for owner and group  
`$ sudo find /path/to/the/directory -type f -exec chmod ug+rw {} \;`
