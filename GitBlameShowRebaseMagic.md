### Clean up some dirty file before commiting  

- find which commit introduced the dirt  
`$ git blame <file>`  

- look at the commit (if needed)  
`$ git show <commit>`  

- rebase just before that commit  
`$ git rebase -i <commit>~1`

- edit the faulty commit and add the file  
`$ git add <file>`  

- finish the rebase  
`$ git rebase --continue`
