### Untrack file in Git

Sometimes, a tracked file need to be modified locally (like a build config file) but pusing it to the remote 
repo is not an option. It is possible to make git forget about it, using this command:  
`$ git update-index --assume-unchanged <file>`  

To track the file again, use the following command:  
`$ git update-index --no-assume-unchanged <file>`
